<!-- Whatever you write below will show up as the speaker's bio -->

Milo코 is a Postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Robotics Laboratory Department at the Czech Technical University in Prague. Milo코' research aims to improve the autonomy of mobile robots on long-term, unsupervised missions in outdoor environments. His main focus is on assessing traversability through complex environments, such as terrains whose traversability changes with time or vegetation that appears rigid but can be passed through.
